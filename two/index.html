<!-- Edincoder Level 1 -> HTML Step 1: Create a <section> element to contain your profile content, and give it a sensible class name for future use -->
<section class="profile-bio">
    <!-- Edincoder Level 1 -> HTML Step 2: Add a profile image inside your profile section using the <img> tag.
         You can either link to an image directly online (e.g. copy url of public profile photo on Facebook/LinkedIn etc.) or upload one to a free image hosting site like ImgBB.
         You may want to add a "style" attribute to your <img> tag with a width value in pixels, to set the size to a reasonable size rather than displaying full size! -->
    <img class="podduck-image" src="https://preview.ibb.co/nJnkKG/20170706_141438_720.jpg" alt="PODDuck Profile Photo"><br/>

    <!-- Edincoder Level 1 -> HTML Step 4: Inside paragraph tag(s) <p>, write a few sentences about yourself. Imagine it's a professional profile, CV blurb or LinkedIn summary! -->

    <!-- Edincoder Level 1 -> HTML Step 5: After your bio paragraph(s), create a <div> tag with class "social-links" - we'll put some links in this in the next step -->
    <div class="social-links">
        <!-- Edincoder Level 1 -> HTML Step 6:
         Inside your social links div, create links (also known as anchors - <a> tag) to your preferred social media profile(s).
         Instead of making these links simple text, let's make these icons - to do this, you'll need an image or drawing of some sort for each.
         A nice way to get consistent-looking icons is to use SVG, a format which represents line drawings.
         If you browse to https://materialdesignicons.com, find the icon for your preferred social network and click "View SVG", you'll get a code which you can copy/past into your <a> tag. -->
